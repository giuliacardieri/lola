# Lola
Lola is a WIP UI components library. The name comes from my dog, Lola, who passed away in 2021 after 16 years being my friend.
The goal of this library is to provide basic UI components such as buttons, accordions, cards, form controls and others that are ready to use and accessible. I added Storybook as a way to document and test each component individually.
My plan is to use these components as a base on future Vue.js projects.
